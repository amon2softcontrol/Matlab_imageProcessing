Videos were recorded with the standard macbook pro iSight camera in full
sunlight, an indoors mixture of sunlight and artificial light, and in purely
artificial lighting. Videos were captured with the PhotoBooth application
included in OS X with 620x426 resolution at ~15 fps. Videos are all 1-2 minutes
in length.

Additional videos were recorded with the kinect RGB camera with the IR source
illuminated and a standard consumer digital camera. Kinect videos were recorded
at ~30 fps and the digital camera videos were ~45 fps.

Links to download test videos will be included after the presentation of
the project.
